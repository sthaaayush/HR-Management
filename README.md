# HR-Management
The HR Management System is a secure and role-based web application designed to simplify employee and administrative operations within an organisation. It provides features such as employee management, user management, leave and attendance handling, task assignments, and role-specific access control.

With Spring Boot as the backend framework, the system implements Spring Security for authentication and authorization, allowing only Admins, HRs, Managers, and Employees to access features according to their roles. Data is managed through MySQL with JPA/Hibernate, ensuring consistency, performance, and scalability.

This application is ideal for organisations that require a centralised, controlled, and efficient HR ecosystem without open registration, where Admins manage all users and permissions.
